#README
This repo shows simple structure for a large text, maybe for a novel, I think. You can typesetting txt files on Word, Write or gedit (using Debian here), and then copy-paste in tex files. Run ConTeXt using:

context master-file 

That produces master-file.pdf, but, if you want to change line spacing on footnote, I mean more line spacing in main text and less line spacing in footnotes: change line spacing on footnote independent of main text, not works on this structure (Run on environment for project?Perhaps manually?). If you found the esoteric trick, give us a hand. 

**Tip** A compromise solution is set up the line spacing on footnote at the end of each chapter.

Obviously, you don't need an Appendix file, is only a sugestion: a novel by parts what each Part contents x number of chapters (each Chapter is a tex file). I prefer Parts rather than a long file. 

ToDo: change line spacing on footnote by page.
